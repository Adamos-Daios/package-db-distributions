# package-db-distributions
Box Database Generator: A Python tool that generates and exports static Excel datasets of box specifications—dimensions, material properties, load capacities, and environmental attributes—for consistent distribution.

Features

Material-Based Generation: Simulates boxes of different materials (Cardboard, Plastic, Wood, Metal, Composite) with weighted probabilities.

Dimensional Variability: Randomizes length, width, height, and thickness based on material-specific options.

Physical Properties: Calculates external and internal volumes (in liters) and load capacities (kg).

Special Attributes: Assigns properties like fragile, stackable, waterproof, and fire retardant according to material probabilities.

Environmental Ranges: Randomizes safe operating temperature ranges per material.

Customization: Includes color and country of origin fields.

Bulk Export: Generates large datasets (e.g., 10,000 boxes) and exports to an Excel file (boxes_database.xlsx).

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

pandas library

(Optional) Google Colab or local Jupyter environment for easy download

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/box-database-generator.git
cd box-database-generator

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas

Usage

Open generate_boxes.py (or your script file) in your Python environment.

Adjust parameters if needed (e.g., number of boxes).

Run the script:

python generate_boxes.py

The script will produce boxes_database.xlsx and prompt for download (in Colab) or save locally.

# Boxes Database

This folder contains a set of pre-generated Excel database files with varying sizes:  
**500**, **1,000**, **3,000**, **5,000**, **10,000**, **50,000**, and **100,000** records.

Each file was created using the `box_generator.py` script and includes randomly generated box specifications such as dimensions, material, weight capacity, and special attributes.

These datasets are intended for researchers working on the **Mixed Palletizing Problem**.  
By using these **fixed, shared datasets**, fellow researchers can:
- Benchmark and compare the performance of their algorithms under identical conditions.
- Ensure consistency and reproducibility in experimental results.
- Showcase innovative approaches on a standardized testing ground.

Researchers are encouraged to reference these files in their work and report results for comparison.
